##################################################
#  *NAME* - Implementation of our work titled	 #
#  "Discovering Causal Clusters (or subgroups)"  #
#  *in Proceedings of AAAI-2021*.					 #
##################################################
	
- This version of *NAME* has been cleaned and commented for the ease of use. The implementation can be further optimized but is not in my immediete plans.
- If you would like to reproduce the results of the experiments stated in the publication, you can find the data and the (automated) version of *NAME* on this link: https://www.***
- There are two files that mainly map to the "Algorithm" section of the publication: **.py (Contains the ranking phase) and **.py ( phases)
- For scoring functions mentioned in the published work, refer to **.py
- This code is not optimized for performance and may contain some unused variables within. Although, I have done my best to resolve the latter.
