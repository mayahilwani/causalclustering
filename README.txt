#  CluC - Implementation of our work titled	 #
#  "Causal Clustering"  #
##################################################
	
- This version of Clue has been cleaned and commented as possible for the ease of use. The implementation can be further optimized but is not in my immediate plans.
- If you would like to reproduce the results of the experiments stated in the publication, you can find the data and the (automated) version of *NAME* on this link: https://www.***
- The main file that maps to the "Algorithm" section of the publication: cc.py (Contains the whole iterative clustering phase)
- For scoring functions mentioned in the published work, also refer to cc.py
- This code is not optimized for performance and may contain some unused variables and extra files intended for testing.
